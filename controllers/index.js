//here we are collecting the packaged group of API endpoints and prefixing them with the path /api. Also, note that second use of router.use(). This is so if we make a request to any endpoint that doesn't exist, we'll receive a 404 error indicating we have requested an incorrect resource, another RESTful API practice.

//Now when we import the routes to server.js, they'll already be packaged and ready to go with this one file! Let's get server.js set up now.

const router = require('express').Router();

const apiRoutes = require('./api');

const homeRoutes = require('./home-routes');

const dashboardRoutes = require('./dashboard-routes');

// middleware to tell what prefixes our routes will use
router.use('/api', apiRoutes);
router.use('/', homeRoutes);
router.use('/dashboard', dashboardRoutes);

router.use((req, res) => {
  res.status(404).end();
});

module.exports = router;
