//n the sync method, there is a configuration parameter { force: false }. If we change the value of the force property to true, then the database connection must sync with the model definitions and associations. By forcing the sync method to true, we will make the tables re-create if there are any association changes.

//This definition performs similarly to DROP TABLE IF EXISTS, which was used previously. This allows the table to be overwritten and re-created

// we change back to force: false so that after we are done editing and creating the tables won't be dropped everytime we re start the server
